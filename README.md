This is my repository for the Data Science Internship project at Oasis Infobyte. I have worked on various data science tasks to gain hands-on experience and improve my skills. The project highlights include implementing Machine Learning algorithms, developing data visualizations, conducting exploratory data analysis, and many more. The technologies used include Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, Machine Learning and more. Check out the code example and follow the getting started steps to explore the project further!
